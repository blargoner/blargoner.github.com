Hello, visitor. My name is John Peloquin. I live in the East Village of Manhattan where I enjoy eating food and listening to garbage trucks. Sometimes I am mistaken for a pelican.

## Software

I write software for [work][spreemo] and [pleasure][github]. I particularly enjoy [front-end web development][undefined.js]. Recent projects include a JavaScript [library][jshue] for Philips Hue, a Google Chrome [extension][cloudwatcher] for Amazon CloudWatch, and some internet [speed][speedy] [test][quicky] tools. I also do freelance technical editing. Here are some books I edited:

- [Reliable JavaScript][books.reliablejs] by Larry Spencer and Seth Richards (2015)
- [Professional Website Performance][books.properf] by Peter Smith (2012)
- [Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, 3rd edition][books.projs] by Nicholas Zakas (2012)
- [JavaScript 24-Hour Trainer][books.js24hr] by Jeremy McPeak (2010)

More information is available [here][linkedin].

## Mathematics

I studied math as an undergraduate at [Berkeley][ucb]. Recently I have been learning more algebra and analysis. Here are some expository papers I wrote:

- [Notes on Mathematics][math.notes] (draft)
- [A Note on Function Notation][math.functions]
- [Zorn's Bowels: The Mechanics of Choice and Recursion][math.zorn]
- [Ehrenfeucht's Game-Theoretic Characterization of First-Order Elementary Equivalence][math.ehrenfeucht]

## Philosophy

Once upon a time I thought I wanted to be a professional philosopher. Here are some short papers I wrote during a brief stint in graduate school at [USC][usc]:

- [Paradoxes of Infinity][phil.infinite]
- [Kripke on Rigid Designation][phil.kripke]
- [Quine on Conventionalism][phil.quine]
- [Tarski on Truth][phil.tarski]
- [Frege on Existence][phil.frege]

Here is another random paper I wrote, before USC:

- [Omniscience and Cosmological Arguments][phil.omniscience]
