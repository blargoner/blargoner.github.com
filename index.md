Hello, visitor. My name is John Peloquin. I like to think of myself as a character clock, sitting on a mushroom, pondering life.

I live in the [East Village][nyc] of Manhattan and enjoy [making][video.stmarks] [videos][video.rockefeller] around the city.

## Software

I write software for [work][spreemo] and [pleasure][github]. I particularly enjoy front-end web development. I also do freelance technical editing. Here are some books I edited:

- [Professional Website Performance][books.properf] by Peter Smith (2012)
- [Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, 3rd edition][books.projs] by Nicholas Zakas (2012)
- [JavaScript 24-Hour Trainer][books.js24hr] by Jeremy McPeak (2010)

More information is available [here][linkedin].

## Mathematics

I studied math as an undergraduate at [Berkeley][ucb]. My primary interests are in foundations (set theory, recursion theory, model theory, and the like). Here are some papers I wrote:

- [Notes on Mathematics][math.notes] (draft)
- [A Note on Function Notation][math.functions]
- [Zorn's Bowels: The Mechanics of Choice and Recursion][math.zorn]
- [Ehrenfeucht's Game-Theoretic Characterization of First-Order Elementary Equivalence][math.ehrenfeucht]

## Philosophy

Once upon a time I thought I wanted to be a professional philosopher. Here are some short papers I wrote during a brief stint in graduate school at [USC][usc]:

- [Paradoxes of Infinity][phil.infinite]
- [Kripke on Rigid Designation][phil.kripke]
- [Quine on Conventionalism][phil.quine]
- [Tarski on Truth][phil.tarski]
- [Frege on Existence][phil.frege]
